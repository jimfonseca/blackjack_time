Given a player's skill level, table rules & minimum bet, etc. can we give novice blackjack players a rule of thumb about how money they should bring to the table in order to play for a certain amount of time with some level of confidence? I've only played in casinos a few times, but I've had the following conversation with people.

Them: Oh, yea I played blackjack once and not anymore. I thought I knew the rules, too. 

Me: How'd it go?

Them: I lost $100 in 3 minutes.

Me: Wow, that sucks, what was the table minimum?

Them: $25. 

Me: ...


1. If you can memorize these rules https://wizardofodds.com/games/blackjack/appendix/21/ 
2. And play at a 'typical' table w/ minimum bet of $10
3. And want to play for 2 hours
4. With a 95% confidence
5. How much should you sit down with?


#Recode this in python
#Looks appealing for handling the game side https://github.com/charleswli/python-blackjack/blob/master/blackjack.py
#Speed aspect https://wizardofodds.com/ask-the-wizard/136/
#Could give user some type of skills test to rate them on a 1-10 or some fudge factor to adjust a little bit.
